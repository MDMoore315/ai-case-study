# Perplexity AI

## Overview and Origin

[Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/hub) was founded in August 2022 by Aravind Srinivas, Denis Yarats, Johnny Ho, and Andy Konwinski. All with extensive experience and backgrounds in AI research, machine learning and backend systems engineering. 

Srinivas has been inspired and influenced by Google's CEO Sundar Pichai after seeing a YouTube interview with Pichai. Srinivas interned at the Google-owned DeepMind and, later, at Google's headquarters as a research intern.

Srinivas and the other cofounders decided to try a new apporach to internet search engines and build an 'answer' engine through combining a traditional search index with large language models. This became Perplexity.

The founders have recently achieved unicorn status through raising $1bn through Series A and Series B funding rounds, including Jeff Bezos and Nvidia, and others, in addition to 'Angel Investors' that believe in their vision.

>"Perplexity is intensely building a product capable of bringing the power of AI to billions. The team possesses the unique ability to uphold a grand, long-term vision while shipping product relentlessly, requirements to tackle a problem as important and fundamental as search.” — Cack Wilhelm, General Partner, IVP, who led the round, and joins Perplexity’s Board of Directors.>

## Business Activities

Achieving 10 million monthly users to date, Perplexity AI strives to brand itself as a concise 'answer engine' through a clean UI void of paid placements or advertisements in its answers. Responses are presented conversationally through Large Language Models (LLM) and using natural language predictive text to answer queries.

Hoping to reach billions of consumers through its conversational search engine to answer queries, Perplexity's free version leverages OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model combined with a standalone LLM with NLP capabilities. These are extended in its Pro version which accesses GPT-4 and Claude 2, utilizing sources from the web.

## Landscape

In direct competition with ventures like Bing, Jasper, ChatGPT, Bard, Gemin; Perplexity's primary focus on reinventing the search engine has expanded from the desktop app to mobile apps, a web browswer API and the Copilot search companion (branded as a  collaborative research partner).

>Academic Research Use Case: Students and academics, meet your ultimate research assistant. Imagine you're knee-deep in literature reviews. Don't just settle for endless scrolling. Pro search not only digs through academic databases but also asks what specifically you're looking for. The result? A tailored list of sources and even summarized papers. Say hello to more time and smarter research. *Source:* [Perplexity Blog](https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/faq/what-is-pro-search)

## Results

Perplexity continuously works to improve its performance and precision as compared to other AI models. The images below demonstrate these achievements in Copilot. Illustrating that Perplexity's GPT-3.5 model is on par wih the GPT-4-based models and reduced latency, producing results in 0.65 seconds. Far better than the previous tests achieving results in 3.15 seconds.

## Recommendations

As a novice in this field of study and a basic user of Perplexity, it is difficult to make anything but reductive recommendations. I would, however, recommend that Perplexity add a prominent call out about the potential for mistakes and/or hallucinations in it's results. Increased transparency can only improve the users experience and build trust.

As many users adopt products like Dall-E and Davinci, I would enjoy seeing what Perplexity is capable of in in this field.
